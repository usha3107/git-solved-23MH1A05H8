## üí™ Most Challenging Parts
- Understanding conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Choosing which code to keep
- Resolving complex script differences
- Testing after resolution

---

## üß† Key Learnings

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills
- Conflict resolution process  
- Working with `git diff`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `reset`, and `reflog`  
- Managing advanced Git operations with confidence  

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Read both sides carefully before deciding  
- Test every change before committing  
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages  
- Use `git status` frequently to stay aware  

### üîÅ Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are **normal** ‚Äî they mean Git needs your decision  
- Always understand both changes before merging  
- Document every resolution step clearly

## üí≠ Reflection
> "Merge conflicts aren‚Äôt scary‚Äîthey‚Äôre Git asking for a decision."

This challenge taught me that patience and understanding are key to conflict resolution. By carefully comparing both versions, testing after each fix, and documenting my process, I became confident in handling even the toughest merges.

Practicing advanced commands like **rebase**, **cherry-pick**, **reset**, and **reflog** showed me how to maintain clean history, recover lost work, and integrate changes safely.

Overall, this challenge helped me build strong version control habits ‚Äî crucial for real-world software engineering and collaborative teamwork.
